  "bio": "Nathan Noack graduated from General Assembly's Software Engineering Immersive program in December 2021. Before that, he was a downtrodden Mechanical Engineer. He became dissatisfied with the many constraints of physical engineering, so he looked elsewhere to learn how to blend creativity with imagination. Now he creates what he loves!"
